Updated Project Initialization Plan
1. Infrastructure & Architecture (Crucial)

[ ] Initialize Cargo.toml (Add tokio with full features, crossbeam-channel for UI communication).

[ ] Setup Async Bridge: Create AppAction and AppEvent enums to decouple UI from Logic.

[ ] Spawn Backend Thread: Initialize tokio runtime in main.rs separate from the UI loop.

2. UI Core & Aesthetics

[ ] Font Loader: Load JetBrains Mono (Code) and a Chinese font fallback.

[ ] Icon Support: Integrate egui-phosphor or load a Nerd Font for GitHub icons (Star, Fork, Branch).

[ ] Create ui/app.rs with State Management (holding the Receiver from backend).

[ ] Implement basic layout: Sidebar, MainArea, Terminal.

3. Visual Effects ( The "Geek" Polish)

[ ] Retro Grid: Implement background grid painter in ui/effects.rs.

[ ] Terminal Animation: Implement a non-blocking typing effect (update text state based on time delta).

[ ] System Status: Add the fake top/bottom status bar.

4. Authentication

[ ] Implement auth.rs logic (triggered via the Async Bridge).

Core Philosophy Change: The user wants to completely abandon the traditional CLI input paradigm on ALL platforms. The UI must be 100% unified between Desktop and Mobile. No typing commands, only clicking/tapping.

Specific Changes:

Redefine Terminal Component:

Rename it to LogViewer.

It must be Read-Only. No text input field.

It displays system status logs with a typewriter effect (e.g., > CONNECTING...).

Introduce CommandDeck Component:

A new UI area (above the LogViewer) containing a grid of 'Action Chips' or Buttons.

Examples of buttons: [REFRESH], [NEW ISSUE], [SYNC], [BROWSE CODE].

Interaction: Clicking a button triggers the async action directly.

Unified Input Handling:

For necessary text inputs (like Issue titles or comments), implement a RetroModal (a popup dialog) that renders in the center of the screen.

This ensures the input experience is identical on Mouse (PC) and Touch (Android).

Goal: The app should feel like a Sci-Fi Spaceship Dashboard, not a terminal emulator."
